# Owner decisions register

Decisions the program cannot take safely on its own. Each row states the safe default the builder applied (if any) and what changes if the owner decides otherwise. Nothing here was executed without a safe default.

| # | Origin | Decision | Safe default applied | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OD-1 | B16.1C | DRC preset `jlcpcb-2l` uses one `minAnnularRingMm 0.15` for vias AND plated-through holes; JLCPCB states PTH absolute min 0.18 mm (rec. 0.25 mm) | B16-C.4 will split via/PTH limits only where the current official page supports separate values, and keep the profile source-pinned | open (scheduled B16-C) |
| OD-2 | B16.1C | `bind_atomic_selection` requires reviewer/project_admin; a `pcb_editor` cannot complete Schematic → PCB alone | B16-C.2 adds a visible review handoff; editors are NOT silently granted reviewer power; 403 for insufficient permission | open (scheduled B16-C) |
| OD-3 | B16.1C | A routed board refuses structural re-sync (Stage 8 copper protection); no product path for post-qualification design changes | B16-C.1 implements a new routed-board revision path (old board + releases immutable); in-place rip-up only as Tier 2 with preview/inverse | open (scheduled B16-C) |
| OD-4 | B16.1C | physical-bindings route maps `HUMAN_REVIEWER_REQUIRED` to HTTP 422 | B16-C.2 changes to 403 with a regression test | open (scheduled B16-C) |
| OD-5 | B16.1B | Drizzle migration 0027 (RLS/policies) is not journal-registered; migrations not deployable through the supported toolchain | B16-B provides one supported migration mechanism with tests against a disposable PostgreSQL when available | open (scheduled B16-B) |
| OD-6 | B16.1B | No isolated Supabase project/account for live auth qualification | stays BLOCKED-LIVE-QUALIFICATION; deterministic seams used | needs owner resource |
| OD-7 | B16.1C | No provider credits for a real LLM turn | fake provider adapters in CI; live turn UNKNOWN | needs owner resource |
| OD-8 | runbook §2.4 | Merging chapter PRs normally after green CI is authorized by the runbook; no force-push, history rewrite, access/billing change, live purchase or production data destruction is authorized | builder merges normally only after gates | standing |
